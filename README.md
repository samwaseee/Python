# Python vs C++ Data Types: Key Differences

Coming from C++ to Python, understanding the differences in how data types work will help you adapt more quickly. Here are the major differentiating factors:

## 1. Static vs Dynamic Typing

**C++:**
- Static typing: variables must be declared with their type before use
- Type checking occurs at compile-time
- Types cannot change once declared

```cpp
int number = 10;      // Type declared explicitly
number = "hello";     // Error: cannot assign string to int
```

**Python:**
- Dynamic typing: variables don't need type declarations
- Type checking occurs at runtime
- Variables can change types

```python
number = 10           # Type inferred as int
number = "hello"      # Valid: number is now a string
```

## 2. Primitive vs Object Types

**C++:**
- Distinguishes between primitive types and objects
- Primitives (int, float, char) are value types stored on stack
- Objects are reference types stored on heap

**Python:**
- Everything is an object (even numbers and booleans)
- All variables are references to objects
- No true primitives like in C++

## 3. Memory Management

**C++:**
- Manual memory management with new/delete
- Direct pointer manipulation
- RAII, smart pointers in modern C++

**Python:**
- Automatic garbage collection
- No direct pointer manipulation
- No need to free memory manually

## 4. Specific Data Type Differences

### Numbers

**C++:**
- Fixed-size types: int, float, double, etc.
- Overflow/underflow behavior is defined
- Type conversion needs explicit casting

```cpp
int i = 5;
double d = 2.5;
double result = i + d;  // Implicit conversion allowed for operands
int narrowed = (int)d;  // Explicit cast required for narrowing
```

**Python:**
- Integers have unlimited precision (no overflow)
- Automatic type conversion in many operations
- Explicit conversion functions (int(), float())

```python
i = 5
d = 2.5
result = i + d  # 7.5 (float)
narrowed = int(d)  # 2
```

### Strings

**C++:**
- `std::string` is mutable, separate from C-strings
- Character arrays and null-termination
- String manipulation often complex

**Python:**
- Strings are immutable sequences of Unicode characters
- Simple, powerful string operations
- Rich methods and slicing capabilities

```python
# Python string operations
s = "hello"
s += " world"  # Creates new string
substring = s[1:4]  # "ell"
```

### Arrays/Lists

**C++:**
- Arrays are fixed-size, homogeneous blocks of memory
- `std::vector` for dynamic arrays
- Type and size often specified at compile time

```cpp
int arr[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};  // Fixed size
std::vector<int> vec = {1, 2, 3};  // Dynamic
vec.push_back(4);  // Add element
```

**Python:**
- Lists are dynamic, heterogeneous collections
- Can hold items of different types
- Growth and shrinking handled automatically

```python
lst = [1, 2, "three", 4.0]  # Mixed types allowed
lst.append(5)  # Add element
```

### Dictionaries vs Maps

**C++:**
- `std::map` is ordered (tree-based)
- `std::unordered_map` is unordered (hash-based)
- Explicitly typed keys and values

```cpp
std::unordered_map<std::string, int> ages;
ages["Alice"] = 30;
```

**Python:**
- Dictionaries are hash-based (like unordered_map)
- Preserve insertion order (since 3.7)
- More concise syntax

```python
ages = {"Alice": 30, "Bob": 25}
```

### Tuples

**C++:**
- `std::tuple` or `std::pair` for fixed heterogeneous collections
- Verbose syntax, less commonly used

```cpp
std::tuple<int, std::string, double> person(30, "John", 5.8);
```

**Python:**
- Tuples are immutable sequences
- Commonly used for multiple return values and small collections
- Simple, concise syntax

```python
person = (30, "John", 5.8)
```

## 5. Type Checking

**C++:**
- Strong type checking at compile time
- Templates for generic programming

**Python:**
- Duck typing: "If it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it's a duck"
- Type hints available but optional (since Python 3.5)

```python
# Python type hints (optional)
def greet(name: str) -> str:
    return "Hello, " + name
```

## 6. Conversion Between Types

**C++:**
- Explicit casting often required
- Strict conversion rules

**Python:**
- Many implicit conversions
- Built-in conversion functions (int(), str(), list(), etc.)

## 7. Custom Types

**C++:**
- Classes with precise control over behavior
- Operator overloading, constructors, destructors

**Python:**
- Classes with dynamic attributes
- "Dunder" methods for operator and behavior customization
- More flexible but less control over memory layout

# Python Collections Compared: List vs Set vs Tuple

All three are built-in collection types in Python, but they have different characteristics that make them suitable for different purposes. Let's compare them across multiple dimensions:

## Core Properties

| Property | List | Set | Tuple |
|----------|------|-----|-------|
| **Mutability** | Mutable | Mutable | Immutable |
| **Order** | Ordered | Unordered* | Ordered |
| **Duplicates** | Allowed | Not allowed | Allowed |
| **Indexing** | Yes | No | Yes |
| **Syntax** | `[1, 2, 3]` | `{1, 2, 3}` | `(1, 2, 3)` |
| **Empty** | `[]` | `set()` | `()` |

*Note: Sets maintain insertion order in Python 3.7+ as an implementation detail, but you shouldn't rely on this.

## Time Complexity

| Operation | List | Set | Tuple |
|-----------|------|-----|-------|
| **Access by index** | O(1) | N/A | O(1) |
| **Search by value** | O(n) | O(1) | O(n) |
| **Insert/Delete at end** | O(1)* | O(1) | N/A |
| **Insert/Delete elsewhere** | O(n) | O(1) | N/A |
| **Contains check (`in`)** | O(n) | O(1) | O(n) |

*Amortized time complexity

## Memory Usage

In general: Tuples < Lists < Sets (for the same data)

Sets have higher overhead due to their hash table implementation, while tuples are slightly more memory-efficient than lists.

## Common Methods and Operations

### List
```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3]
my_list.append(4)       # Add item
my_list.extend([5, 6])  # Add multiple items
my_list.insert(0, 0)    # Insert at position
my_list.remove(3)       # Remove by value
my_list.pop()           # Remove and return last item
my_list.sort()          # Sort in-place
my_list.reverse()       # Reverse in-place
```

### Set
```python
my_set = {1, 2, 3}
my_set.add(4)           # Add item
my_set.update([5, 6])   # Add multiple items
my_set.remove(3)        # Remove (raises KeyError if not found)
my_set.discard(3)       # Remove (no error if not found)
my_set.pop()            # Remove and return an arbitrary element

# Set operations
other_set = {3, 4, 5}
union = my_set | other_set        # Union
intersection = my_set & other_set # Intersection
difference = my_set - other_set   # Difference
sym_diff = my_set ^ other_set     # Symmetric difference
```

### Tuple
```python
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)
# No methods to modify the tuple (immutable)
count = my_tuple.count(2)   # Count occurrences
index = my_tuple.index(3)   # Find position

# Common operations
length = len(my_tuple)
concatenated = my_tuple + (4, 5)  # Creates new tuple
repeated = my_tuple * 2           # Creates new tuple
```

## When to Use Each Type

### Use Lists When:
- You need a mutable, ordered sequence
- You need to frequently modify the collection
- Order matters and indexing is important
- You need to store duplicate items
- You want to represent a sequence of related items that can change

### Use Sets When:
- You need to ensure uniqueness of elements
- You need to perform set operations (union, intersection, etc.)
- Fast membership testing is important
- Order doesn't matter
- You want to eliminate duplicates from another collection

### Use Tuples When:
- You need an immutable sequence (that cannot be changed)
- You want to use the collection as a dictionary key or set element
- You want to represent fixed data like coordinates (x, y)
- You want to ensure data integrity (prevent modification)
- You want a slightly more memory-efficient collection than a list
- You're unpacking multiple return values from a function

## Practical Examples

### List Example - Task Management
```python
# A to-do list where order and modifications matter
tasks = ["Write report", "Email client", "Prepare presentation"]
tasks.append("Call team meeting")
tasks.remove("Email client")  # Task completed
tasks.insert(0, "Check emails")  # Prioritize task
```

### Set Example - Unique Collection
```python
# Track unique user IDs visiting a webpage
visitors = set()
def track_visit(user_id):
    visitors.add(user_id)
    return len(visitors)  # Total unique visitors

# Find common elements
python_users = {"Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"}
java_users = {"Bob", "Dave", "Eve"}
users_who_know_both = python_users & java_users  # {"Bob"}
```

### Tuple Example - Fixed Data Structure
```python
# Geographic coordinates (shouldn't change)
location = (40.7128, -74.0060)  # New York City

# Function returning multiple values
def get_dimensions():
    return (1920, 1080)  # width, height

# Tuple unpacking
width, height = get_dimensions()

# Using tuples as dictionary keys (lists can't be used as keys)
distances = {
    (0, 0): 0,
    (1, 0): 1,
    (0, 1): 1
}
```

## Conversion Between Types

```python
# Converting between types
my_list = [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3]
my_set = set(my_list)          # {1, 2, 3} (duplicates removed)
my_tuple = tuple(my_set)       # (1, 2, 3)
back_to_list = list(my_tuple)  # [1, 2, 3]
```

## Performance Comparison for Common Operations

```python
import time

# Setup
list_collection = list(range(10000))
set_collection = set(range(10000))
tuple_collection = tuple(range(10000))

# Membership testing
def test_membership(collection, iterations=1000):
    start = time.time()
    for i in range(iterations):
        _ = 9999 in collection
    return time.time() - start

print(f"List membership: {test_membership(list_collection):.6f} seconds")
print(f"Set membership: {test_membership(set_collection):.6f} seconds")
print(f"Tuple membership: {test_membership(tuple_collection):.6f} seconds")
```

## Best Practices

1. **Use the right collection for the job** - match the data structure to your needs
2. **For constants, use tuples** - signal that values shouldn't change
3. **For sets of unique items, use sets** - automatic duplicate prevention
4. **For sequences that need modification, use lists** - most flexible option
5. **Use built-in conversions when needed** - `list()`, `set()`, `tuple()`
